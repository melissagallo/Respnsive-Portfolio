      <p>As a Corel PAINTER MASTER ELITE member, Melissa Gallo brings to the digital table a long history of artwork in traditional
        media. Painting in acrylics and oils as a commercial illustrator for over 20 years, her work has been featured on
        the covers of books for several of the major publishing houses in both New York and Milan.</p>

      <p> Melissa's experience as a traditional painter and photographer inform her digital work and she delights in replicating
        traditional media techniques while enjoying the specific advantages of the new digital medium. Now working as a portrait
        painter and digital art instructor in Photoshop and Corel's Painter software, Melissa resides with her family in
        Florida.
